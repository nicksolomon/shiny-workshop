# Getting started with `shiny`

Fork this repo and download the slides from [here](http://www.bit.ly/shiny-quickstart-1).

Make sure you have `shiny` installed! Run:
```r
install.packages("shiny")
```

## Agenda

### What is shiny?

Shiny is a package that lets you make interactive web apps using R. Use shiny
to make interactive data visualizations. For some examples, look at the 
[RStudio shiny gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).

### Making a shiny app

Click `File > New File > Shiny Web App...`. It's that easy! This creates a fully
functional shiny app that you can start to customize.

### Dissecting this example

Now we'll use the slides from RStudio to talk about exactly what's going on in this
minimal app and what kind of changes it's possible to make.

### Digression: HTML Widgets

Use HTML Widgets to add impressive interactive visualizations to shiny apps (or
R Markdown documents). Some of my favorites:

- [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
- [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
- [NDTV](http://statnet.csde.washington.edu/workshops/SUNBELT/current/ndtv/ndtv_workshop.html)


### Customizing our app!

This is where the fun starts. Make your own interactive app using the data set 
in the demo-app folder.

### Sharing our apps (if there's time)

Publish apps to [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io)
